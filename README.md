# Regression-with-Keras-Deep-Learning-Library-in-Python
## In this repository, you will know about:

1. How to make datasets available to **Keras**. 
2. How to create a **neural network model** with **Keras** for a **regression problem**.
3. How to use scikit-learn with **Keras** to evaluate models using **cross validation**. 
4. How to tune the network topology of models with **Keras**.
5. How to use **scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline** framework to perform the **standardization** during the model evaluation process.

Here I have used **Boston house price dataset**.
You can [download](https://github.com/aa-gamJain/Regression-with-Keras-Deep-Learning-Library-in-Python/blob/master/housing.csv) this dataset and save it to your current working directly with the file name **housing.csv** and open the Ipython file to directly run the cells code.
